  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Empanadas are a popular and traditional Chilean dish, consisting of a savory pastry filled with various
    ingredients, then folded and baked or fried to perfection. The dough is usually made from flour, butter, and water,
    creating a slightly crispy yet soft texture when cooked.</p>
  <p>The most iconic Chilean empanada is the empanada de pino, which typically contains a mixture of ground beef,
    onions, hard-boiled eggs, black olives, raisins, and a touch of cumin. This filling combines savory and sweet
    flavors, giving the dish a unique taste. Other variations of empanadas can be filled with seafood, cheese, or
    vegetables, depending on regional preferences.</p>
