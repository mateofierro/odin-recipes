  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Empanadas are a popular and traditional Chilean dish, consisting of a savory pastry filled with various
    ingredients, then folded and baked or fried to perfection. The dough is usually made from flour, butter, and water,
    creating a slightly crispy yet soft texture when cooked.</p>
  <p>The most iconic Chilean empanada is the empanada de pino, which typically contains a mixture of ground beef,
    onions, hard-boiled eggs, black olives, raisins, and a touch of cumin. This filling combines savory and sweet
    flavors, giving the dish a unique taste. Other variations of empanadas can be filled with seafood, cheese, or
    vegetables, depending on regional preferences.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h3>Filling:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
    <li>1 cup raisins</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped black olives</li>
    <li>3 large hard-cooked eggs, chopped</li>
    <li>1 cup water</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Dough:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup lukewarm milk</li>
    <li>1 cup shortening, melted</li>
    <li>5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Make the filling: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, oregano, cumin, salt, and
      pepper; cook and stir until onion is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add pork and cook until completely browned and
      crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes more. Drain fat from the skillet. Stir in raisins, olives, and hard-cooked eggs.</li>
    <li>Whisk water and cornstarch together in a small bowl; pour into the skillet and stir until liquid thickens.
      Remove from the heat and set aside.</li>
    <li>Make the dough: Whisk milk and melted shortening together in a bowl until evenly blended. Stir flour and salt
      together in a separate large bowl. Pour milk mixture into flour mixture; whisk until well combined and a dough
      forms. Let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Roll dough on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 1/8 inch. Cut into 12 circles with a round cookie
      cutter or glass. Spoon filling into the center of each circle. Fold each circle in half and press the edges with a
      fork to seal. Brush the tops with beaten egg. Place empanadas onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
